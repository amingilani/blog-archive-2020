**TLDR**: A source available license that converts to open source upon payment. See the code.

#### Freedom ≠ Beer

> Permission is hereby granted, **free of charge**..  
>  — The MIT License

There’s nothing wrong with charging for software. The current norm of releasing software free of charge is overrated. Authors should get paid for their work.

#### How It Works

For simplification, I’ll raise similarities between this license and knighthood.

-   **The King (Copyright Holder)** can make a **Knight (Licensee)**
-   Any **Knight (Licensee)** can make a **Knight (Licensee)**
-   A Knight can **jump over any pieces on the chessboard (Use the software according to the License)**
-   To be conferred Knighthood, you must **prove your mettle (Pay a Knight)**

#### The Name

It’s called the **Pay To Open Source License** and can be shortened to either **PTOS** or **PT-\***. The name changes depending upon the unlock license, e.g. if Payment unlocks the MIT license, you can call it the **Pay To MIT License**, or **PT-MIT** for short.

#### Downstream License Compatibility

Any Open Source license can be PT-\* licensed. For copyleft licenses, the PT-\* license allows the new Licensee to use the the PT-\* variant they received the license under. E.g. PT-GPL can sublicense under the PT-GPL.

#### Upstream License Compatibility

Any software obtained under a [permissive](https://opensource.org/faq#permissive) license can be PT-\* licensed. These include:

-   ISC license Internet Systems Consortium
-   CC-BY Creative Commons 4.0
-   XCore Open Source License
-   Unlicense
-   BSD License
-   MIT license
-   Apache License
-   Creative Commons Zero
