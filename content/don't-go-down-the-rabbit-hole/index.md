For the umpteenth time since I began trying to start a startup, I’ve gone down another rabbit hole.

> rabbit hole: used to refer to a bizarre, confusing, or nonsensical situation or environment, typically one from which it is difficult to extricate oneself.

Most of my rabbit holes start with a shiny new piece of technology:

-   Let’s use the Hatch grant to deploy to Kubernetes instead of Heroku.
-   HTTP messages between services are nice for a hack, but Kafka would be awesome.
-   This development workflow won’t scale to more than myself, let’s recreate this in Docker Compose.

Some are features that would be nice to have:

-   I mean, we’re using email notifications, how more difficult can SMS notifications be? They’re easy!
-   Before I launch this, I should improve my test coverage.
-   I should setup CI and automated tests before I start developing, it’ll save time in the long run.

Some times I just get so distracted
