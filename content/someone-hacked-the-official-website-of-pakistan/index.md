Someone Hacked the Official Website of Pakistan

_Update:_ I found a screenshot, don’t know who to credit it to:

Regardless of your views on the political situation, you have to hand it to some people. It takes quite a bit of courage (or stupidity) to tamper with a government website. I do not know who did this, I do not know when it was done, all I found was [this thread on reddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/2f3fry/) Yes, it’s ridiculous and yes, childish but let’s not take life too seriously.

By the time I found this, the website had been taken offline, so I grabbed the HTML code off of a cached version of the website, and cleaned it up for better viewing. The presentation has been stripped away and the images saved locally, but the the message has been preserved.

Behold, I give you a message from the Prime Minister (lol) that appeared on the [Official Website of Pakistan](http://pakistan.gov.pk/):

> _MESSAGE OF THE GULLU-E-AZAM_

> _As you are aware that I Mian Nawaz Sharif am the most corrupt politician and the most corrupt prime minister in Pakistan’s history. I have been killing innocent people from a long time now. Therefore, many people named me as a “Killer” and a “Murderer”. Few days ago, I had sent many Gullu butts to Islamabad at Imran Khan’s Azadi March in police uniform. All Pakistani’s wanted me to resign, therefore I told my Gullu butts to start killing innocent children, women and men at the Azadi March. I always cheated in politics and I always will._

> _However, I am not the only one that is killing innocent people around in Pakistan. One of my best friend “The Joker AKA Asif Ali Zardari” who killed his own wife and wifes brother is working with me too. Our plan is to destroy Pakistan nice and slowly. People always wanted a change in the country, but we never gave them and never will !_

> _Thank you for reading and understanding._

> _Pakistan Zindabad_

**Hey Government people:** _if you make a State website in the future, I recommend you hire people that know what they’re doing. There are plenty of talented web designers in Pakistan, and not only are your websites (so obviously) insecure but your current designs look horrible._
