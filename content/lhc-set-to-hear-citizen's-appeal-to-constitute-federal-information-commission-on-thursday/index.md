_Lahore High Court appealed to constitute Federal Information Commission and ensure petitioner application is dealt with according to law._

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Wednesday, Oct 17, 2018**

**_Contact: Amin Shah Gilani

_Update Oct 17, 2018: The Hon. Justice Shahid Karim has postponed the hearing for December 3, 2018._

**Lahore, Pakistan:** The Single Bench of the Honorable Lahore High Court is set to hear _Writ Petition 231349/2018_ requesting the constitution of the Federal Information Commission as decreed by law, and directing it to grant relief to the petitioner — in their follow-up petition to the Federal Information Commission against the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority on violating _The Right of Access to Information Act, 2017_.

After a benign internet service he depended upon was inexplicably blocked— and his emails repeatedly met with silence—Amin Shah Gilani, in his capacity as a concerned Citizen of Pakistan, exercised the rights guaranteed to him by the _Constitution of Pakistan_, and _The Right of Access to Information Act, 2017 (The Act)._ Gilani filed a request with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) on May 13, 2018. The request asked PTA to turn over all public records related to restricted internet resources, along with the reason for their restrictions.

> (xii) “right of access to information” means the right of access to information accessible under this Act which is held by or under the control of any public body and includes the right of access to information, documents or record in digital or printed form, as the case may be.  
>  — The Right of Access to Information Act, 2017

The PTA failed to respond to Gilani’s request entirely in direct violation of the Act. On July 2, 2018, the Single Bench of the Honorable Lahore High Court (LHC) ordered the Chairperson, PTA to deal with Gilani’s request. This order was issued in response to _Writ Petition 222681/2018_ filed by Gilani, through counsel Advocate Arslan Akram.

> **14\. Time limit for responding.-** (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a public body shall be required to respond to a request as soon as possible and in any case within ten working days of receipt of the request.  
>  — The Right of Access to Information Act, 2017

PTA responded to Gilani in a letter dated July 24, 2018, admitting to the requested documents as unclassified public records, but refusing to provide them. Gilani found PTA’s refusal unsatisfactory and another direct violation of the rules laid out under The Act. He then wrote an appeal to the Honorable Pakistan Commission on Access to Information (also called the Information Commission) — as required by the Act — and found that the Commission had not yet been formed, despite the stipulated deadline for its formation having expired.

> **18\. Information Commission.**\- (1) Within six months of the commencement of this Act, the Prime Minister shall establish Pakistan Commission on Access to Information to be known as the Information Commission.  
>  — The Right of Access to Information Act, **passed August 22, 2017**

Gilani and counsel have since filed _Writ Petition 231349/2018_ requesting the LHC to direct the Federal Government to form the Information Commission and for the said Commission to deal with Gilani’s application in accordance with the process laid out in the Act. This petition is scheduled to be heard on **Thursday, October 18, 2018**.

He prays that the Honorable High Court will direct the Federal Government to comply with the mandatory provisions of the Act, and ensure compliance with the letter and spirit of the law and Constitution.

**About the Petitioner:** [Amin Shah Gilani](https://amin.gilani.me/?utm_source=medium&utm_campaign=petition2313492018) is an entrepreneur, a full-stack web developer, a contributor of open-source code, and — in his spare time — an author of technical content. However, for the purposes of this petition, he identifies as a concerned Citizen of Pakistan performing his civic duty.

**About the Counsel:** [Arslan Akram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arslan-akram-9ba913103/) of The Honourable Society of Gray’s Inn is an Advocate of the High Court, and Senior Associate Counsel at Altaf and Altaf.
